 # Brain Tumor Classification and Detection - Deep Learning Approach

 ## Overview

 Cancer is one of the most deadliest disease that we face today. Detecting tumors early can serve as a potential indicators of cancer which is crucial in our fight against  this formidable adversary. As AI tools continue to evolve and find applications in medicine and image diagnostics, they become valuable allies in tumor detection alongside healthcare professionals.However, itâ€™s essential to emphasize that AI should not replace professional diagnosis. Instead, it serves as a supportive tool, assisting clinicians in their assessments.


 In this project, we are using the deep learning model named CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) for detecting whether the brain images provided to us has tumor in it or not.

## Dataset

The brain tumor dataset has two sets of folder 'No' and 'Yes'.

(i) No folder = It contains the list of all the brain images that are not detected with brain tumor. There are total 98 images that are not detected with brain tumor.

(ii) Yes folder = It contains the list of all the brain images that are detected with brain tumor.   There are total 155 images that are detected with brain tumor.
